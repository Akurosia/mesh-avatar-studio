# Agent guide: turn one illustration into a mesh avatar

This guide is for a coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor CLI or similar) working in this
repository. A person gives you one illustration and asks for an avatar. You build a project
that the editor can open and that animates cleanly; the person then fine-tunes it in the editor.

Work through the steps in order. Each step ends with a check. Do not skip the checks: the
quality of the result depends on looking at your own output and correcting it.

## Before you start

### Tools
Node.js 22.17+, Python 3.10+ with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), and Playwright Chromium
(`npx playwright install chromium`). Run `npm install` once.

### Model
Reading pixel coordinates from images needs strong vision. These setups are known to work:

| Agent | Model |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | Claude Opus 5.5 |
| Codex | GPT-6.1 Sol |

Tell the person which model you are running as. If it is not listed above, or you do not know,
say that the result may fall short, name the recommended setups, and ask whether to continue.

### Vision check
Run the calibration test and report the score to the person:

```sh
uv run tools/vision-check.py make work/vision-check   # writes an image with numbered markers
# read the image, write your answer as JSON (see the command output for the format), then:
uv run tools/vision-check.py score work/vision-check answer.json
```

If the score fails, stop and tell the person: coordinates read by this model are likely to be
off, and most of the work below would need manual correction.

### The image
- Ask for a PNG, ideally with a transparent background, roughly front-facing, head and
  shoulders visible. Warn the person if the face is in strong three-quarter view, if hands
  or objects cover the face, or if the hair heavily overlaps the face: these limit quality.
- The image stays on this machine inside `projects/`, which is not committed. Never commit,
  upload or copy it elsewhere. The only exception is Step 6, and only after the person agrees:
  generating drawn variants sends the image and a mask to an image generator.

## Step 1 — Create the project

```sh
uv run tools/new-project.py <path/to/image.png> <name>
```

This creates `projects/<name>/` with `source.png` and an empty `rig.draft.json` that has the
image size filled in. Field meanings are in `docs/rig-fields.md`; `samples/miko-qipao/rig.json`
is a complete example.

## Step 2 — Survey the image

```sh
uv run tools/grid.py projects/<name> --step 50 --out projects/<name>/work/grid-full.png
```

Look at the full grid image and write down, in your notes to the person:
- face centre, top of head (including hair and accessories), chin, neck, shoulders;
- which optional parts exist: hand near the face, hair buns, hanging accessories
  (tassels, earrings), long hair over the shoulders;
- anything the rig cannot represent yet (hats, glasses, objects held in front of the face).
  Tell the person these will move rigidly with the head or body.

## Step 3 — Draft the rig

Fill `rig.draft.json` part by part. For each part, make a zoomed grid of its region first and
read coordinates from it — never estimate from the full image alone.

```sh
uv run tools/grid.py projects/<name> --region x0,y0,x1,y1 --step 10 --out projects/<name>/work/grid-eyes.png
```

| Part | How to place it |
|---|---|
| head | Ellipse covering the whole head including hair and head accessories; centre slightly above the eyes. Pivot at the neck. `weightBand` starts just below the chin and ends near the collarbone. |
| face | Small ellipses on nose, mouth, each eye, each visible ear, brow, jaw. |
| eyes | `opening`: polygon along the visible eye white + iris, inside the lashes, 14–20 points, starting at the outer corner. `roi`: polygon 10–20 px outside the lashes and lower lid line. Use a 5 px grid for these. |
| mouth | Line through the closed mouth (centre, angle, half length, bow) and an ellipse `area` a little larger than the lips. |
| cheeks | Centre of each blush area. |
| strands | One polyline per visible hair lock that should sway, root to tip, 4 nodes. Bangs: 3–5 locks. Side hair: 2 per side. |
| body | Chest ellipse, one ellipse per shoulder, breath band from the upper chest to the bottom. |
| buns, accessories, hand | Only if present. |
| mesh, view | Start from the values in `samples/miko-qipao/rig.json`; set `mesh.fine` to a rectangle around the face and hair. |

Leave `eyes[*].x0/x1/top/bot` out of the draft; the layer builder computes them.

Notes:
- Eye 0 is the eye on the image's left. Angles are in radians.
- The head ellipse is an area of influence, not a cut-out. When covering all hair and head
  accessories forces it to touch the top of the shoulders or a collar, cover the hair and
  accept the small overlap.
- For eye `roi`, the whole lash and lower lid line must be inside. If widening it would pull
  in bangs or side hair, keep it tight around the lashes and list that eye as a place to check.
- Your first draft is unverified until Check 3 passes.

### Check 3
```sh
npm run validate-rig -- projects/<name>/rig.draft.json
uv run tools/overlay.py projects/<name> --rig rig.draft.json --out projects/<name>/work/overlay.png
uv run tools/overlay.py projects/<name> --rig rig.draft.json --part eyes --zoom --out projects/<name>/work/overlay-eyes.png
```
Look at every overlay and fix what is off. Pass when:
- the head ellipse contains all hair and head accessories, and no shoulder;
- each eye `opening` follows the eye white edge within about 2 px all around;
- each `roi` contains the whole lash and lower lid line;
- the mouth line lies on the drawn mouth;
- strands lie on hair, not on skin or background.

## Step 4 — Build layers

```sh
uv run --with numpy --with pillow --with opencv-python-headless tools/build-layers.py projects/<name> --rig rig.draft.json
```

This writes `projects/<name>/built/` and the complete `projects/<name>/rig.json`.

### Check 4
Open `built/hairmask.png` and the eye layers: the hair mask covers all hair and no face or
clothing; each eye ball layer contains the eye white and iris only.

## Step 5 — Review motion

```sh
npm run render-poses -- projects/<name>
```

This renders the avatar in fixed poses (rest, half and closed eyes, mouth open, turn left and
right, look up and down, tilt, body tilt, and a hair sway sequence) into
`projects/<name>/review/`, with a contact sheet and zoomed eye and mouth crops.

Look at every frame. Pass when:
- closed eyes are fully closed, with one clean lash line and no leftover iris or white;
- turning ±30° and tilting do not tear the mesh, cut the chin or ears, or bend accessories;
- the mouth opens without stretching the chin;
- hair sways while face and clothing stay still.

Review frames use a wider margin than the editor so the whole image is visible; framing
differences between the two are expected.

If a frame fails, adjust the related part of the draft, rebuild (Step 4) and render again.
Stop after three rounds and report what still fails.

Without drawn variants, a closed eye can keep faint fragments of the original upper lash or
crease above the closed line. If iris and white are gone and only such faint lines remain,
the rig is good enough: continue to Step 6, which removes them.

## Step 6 — Drawn variants (closed eyes, mouth shapes)

Blinking and talking look much better with drawn variants. Create the requests:

```sh
uv run tools/variant-requests.py projects/<name>
```

This writes `projects/<name>/variant-requests/` with, for each variant (closed / half /
smiling eyes; mouths あ, half あ, い, お): an edit mask, the prompt, and a README.

Ask the person before generating: image generation sends `source.png` and a mask to the
generator. If they decline, stop here; the avatar still works without variants.

- If you can generate images (for example Codex with image generation), generate each variant
  from `source.png` and its mask following the prompt, and save it to
  `projects/<name>/variants/<variant>.png`.
- Otherwise stop here and tell the person exactly which files to give to an image generator
  and where to put the results. Continue when they say the files are in place.

In each mask, transparent pixels may change and opaque pixels must stay identical. Many
generators recompress or shift the whole image; if a variant is rejected for changes outside
the mask, generate it again, asking explicitly for identical size and untouched pixels outside
the masked area.

Then:
```sh
uv run tools/build-sprites.py projects/<name>
```
It rejects variants whose size differs from the source or that change pixels outside the
mask, and cuts accepted variants into `built/sprites/`. Render the poses again (Step 5).

## Step 7 — Hand over

Tell the person:
- how to open the project: `npm run dev`, then **Open project** and
  choose `projects/<name>` from the list or browse for its folder;
- which parts you are least sure about and should be checked first;
- what the rig cannot represent in this image;
- that after editing eye or hand outlines they should save the rig and ask you to rebuild.

## Not acceptable
- Coordinates estimated from the full image without zoomed grids.
- Skipping the overlay or pose checks, or reporting success without looking at the images.
- Eye openings that include lashes or skin; closed eyes that show iris.
- Committing, uploading or copying the person's image or anything built from it.
- Editing `samples/` or `reference/` to make a new image work.
